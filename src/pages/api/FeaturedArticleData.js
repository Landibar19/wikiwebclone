        description: `The Benty Grange helmet is a boar-crested
         helmet of Anglo-Saxon origin, from the 7th century.
          It was excavated by Thomas Bateman in 1848 from a 
          burial mound at the Benty Grange farm in Monyash in 
          western Derbyshire. The grave had probably been looted 
          by the time of Bateman's excavation, but still contained 
          the helmet and other high-status objects suggestive of a
           richly furnished burial, such as the fragmentary remains
            of a hanging bowl. The ornate helmet was constructed by
             covering the outside of an iron framework with plates 
             of horn and the inside with cloth or leather, 
             now decayed. It would have provided some protection 
             against weapons, but may have also been intended for 
             ceremonial use. It was the first Anglo-Saxon helmet 
             to be discovered; others have been found at Sutton Hoo,
             at York, at Wollaston, at Shorwell, and in Staffordshire.
             The Benty Grange helmet is displayed at Sheffield's 
             Weston Park Museum,which purchased it from Bateman's estate in 1893.
